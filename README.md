Files related to and accessible from the admin module will be found in /admin/ directory

Likewise, the user accessible directory can be found in /www/

All underlying logic and methodologies, functions, classes, plugins, will be found on the root directory which will not be accessible from the web browser for added security.

Database backups will be done periodically and can be found in /db_backups/ directory
