Project-Libra
=============

Android Library Hub

===

Potential site names to be added below, and we'll pick one later (use < br / > for intentation):

libdroid.com <br/>
android-libs.com <br/>
droidlibs.com <br/>
libradroid.com <br/>
devdriod.com <br/>

===

When commiting any change, in the commit message specify what part of the project this commit corresponds to. For example, if the changes are related to admin portal then the msg should start "Admin: added a page" and if its the site then "Site: 404 page". 

===

Files related to and accessible from the admin module will be found in /admin/ directory

Likewise, the user accessible directory can be found in /www/

All underlying logic and methodologies, functions, classes, plugins, will be found on the root directory which will not be accessible from the web browser for added security.

Database backups will be done periodically and can be found in /db_backups/ directory
